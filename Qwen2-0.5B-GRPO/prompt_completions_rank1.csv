There are 15 tables in the school's cafeteria. Each table can seat 10 people. Usually, only 1/10 of the seats are left unseated. How many seats are usually taken?"," Since there are 15 tables in total and each table can seat 10 people, the total number of seats available is:

15 tables × 10 people/table = 150 seats

Usually, only 1/10 of these seats are left unseated, so:

150 seats × (1/10) = 15 seats usually taken

Therefore, 15 seats are usually taken in the cafeteria. However, since we typically don't have a 1% chance of leaving a seat unoccupied, this means that approximately 24 seats are usually taken, considering the 150 seats are always available. The answer is $\boxed{24}$. Is there anything else you would like me to assist you with?",68,160,24,0.0,"The cafeteria can seat 15 x 10 = <<15*10=150>>150 people.

Thus, 150 - 15 = <<150-15=135>>135 seats are usually taken.

Fiona completed 36 math questions in an hour. Shirley was able to complete twice as many math questions within that same time, and Kiana completed half of the sum of Fiona and Shirley's math questions. If they each did the same number of questions the following hour, how many math questions did all three girls complete in 2 hours?"," Let's break down the problem into steps that can be solved independently:

1. **Fiona's Math Questions:**
   She completed 36 math questions in an hour.

2. **Shirley's Math Questions:**
   Shirley can complete twice as many questions as Fiona. So, Shirley completed \(36 \times 2 = 72\) math questions in an hour.

3. **Kiana's Math Questions:**
   Kiana completed half the sum of Fiona and Shirley's math questions. The sum is \(36 + 72 = 108\) questions. So, Kiana completed \(108 \div 2 = 54\) math questions in an hour.

4. **Total Math Questions in 2 Hours:**
   Adding Fiona, Shirley, and Kiana's totals, we get:
   \(\text{Total Questions} = 36 + 72 + 54 = 162\) questions in 2 hours.

Therefore, in 2 hours, all three girls together completed a total of 162 math questions. However, you asked for the answer rounded to the nearest whole number, but you didn't specify the rounds. If you mean to round up because it's a whole number, rounding up to 2 (if you've got the exact answer you're looking for) and considering that Fiona, Shirley, and Kiana collectively completed more than 162 in 2 hours, rounding up will give you that number.

Marie has 98 unread messages on her phone. She decides to clear them by reading 20 messages a day. However, she also gets 6 new messages a day. How many days will it take her to read all her unread messages?"," 

To solve this problem, we can break it down into two steps:

1. Calculate the number of unread messages Marie needs to read after 7 days (since she starts by reading 20 messages a day for the first 7 days). The formula for this is:

\[ \text{Number of unread messages remaining} = \text{Number of unread messages} - 20 \times 7 \]

2. Since she gets 6 new messages a day, we can calculate the number of messages she will have after 7 days:

\[ \text{Number of messages after 7 days} = \text{Number of unread messages} - 20 \times 7 + 6 \times 7 \]

3. To find out how many days it will take her to read all her unread messages, we can subtract the number of unread messages she has already from the total number of unread messages needed:

\[ \text{Days} = \frac{\text{Total number of unread messages needed}}{\text{Number of messages after 7 days}} \]

Let's do the math:

1. Number of unread messages to read after 7 days:
\[ \text{Number of unread messages} = 98 - 20 \times 7 = 98 - 140 = -42 \]

Since the number of unread messages cannot be negative, Marie will need to read all her unread messages before she can read them out of her phone. The answer is:

\[ -42 \] days. 

This means it will take Marie 42 days to read all her unread messages on her phone.",75,338,42,0.0,"Marie will read 20 but gain 6 unread messages a day, so she will lower the number of messages by 20 - 6 = <<20-6=14>>14.
