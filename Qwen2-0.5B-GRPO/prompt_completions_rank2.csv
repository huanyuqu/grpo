In a graveyard, there are 20 skeletons.  Half of these skeletons are adult women, and the remaining number are split evenly between adult men and children.  If an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, and a male has 5 more than this, and a child has half as many as an adult woman, how many bones are in the graveyard?"," Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Half of the skeletons:**
   - If there are 20 skeletons in total, half of that number means we have \(20/2 = 10\) adult women skeletons.
   - If an adult woman has 20 bones, then 10 adult women have \(10 \times 20 = 200\) bones in total.

2. **The remaining skeletons are split evenly between adult men and children:**
   - After accounting for the adult women, there are 10 skeletons left.
   - The remaining skeletons amount to \(10 \times 20 = 200\) bones.

3. **An adult man has 5 more bones than an adult woman:**
   - Since there are 10 adult women, each has 20 bones.
   - An adult man has 20 + 5 = 25 bones.
   - So, 10 adult men have \(10 \times 25 = 250\) bones.

4. **A child has half as many bones as an adult woman:**
   - An adult woman has 20 bones.
   - A child has half as many bones, so they have \(20/2 = 10\) bones.
   - So, 10 children have \(10 \times 20 = 200\) bones.

5. **Total bones:**
   - The total number of bones in the graveyard is the sum of the bones from all the skeletons: \(200 + 250 + 200 = 650\) bones.

Therefore, 6,500 bones are in the graveyard. The final answer is: $\boxed{6500}$ bones. If you have any more math problems or questions, feel free to ask!",100,394,6500,0.0,"We first need to figure out how many of each type of skeleton there are. Since half the 20 skeletons are adult women, that means there are 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 adult women's skeletons.
The remaining half, 10, is split between adult men and children, meaning there are 10/2= <<10/2=5>>5 of each.
Since an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, this means that the 10 skeletons have 20*10=<<20*10=200>>200 bones in total.
Since an adult man has 5 more bones in their body than an adult woman, this means they have 20+5= <<20+5=25>>25 bones in their body.
There are 5 adult men, meaning there are 25*5=<<25*5=125>>125 bones in the adult male skeletons in total.
Since a child has half as many bones as the 20 in an adult woman, this means the children have 20/2= <<20/2=10>>10 bones in their body.
Since there are 5 children, this means there are 5*10= <<5*10=50>>50 bones in the children's skeletons in total.
Therefore, altogether there are 50+125+200= <<50+125+200=375>>375 bones in total in the graveyard.

In a graveyard, there are 20 skeletons.  Half of these skeletons are adult women, and the remaining number are split evenly between adult men and children.  If an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, and a male has 5 more than this, and a child has half as many as an adult woman, how many bones are in the graveyard?"," Please reason step by step.
 First, we need to find out how many adult women are there. Since half of the 20 skeletons are adult women, that means there are $20/2 = 10$ adult women skeletons.

Next, we need to find out how many of these adult women skeletons are male. Since an adult woman has 20 bones and a male has 5 more than this, that means a male skeleton has $20+5 = 25$ bones.

Since there are 10 adult women skeletons, the total number of bones in adult women is $10 \times 20 = 200$.

Similarly, since there are 10 adult women skeletons, the total number of bones in all adult women skeletons is $10 \times 25 = 250$.

Since the remaining skeletons are split evenly between adult men and children, we can find out how many skeletons are male by dividing the 10 adult women skeletons by 2. That is, the number of male skeletons is $10/2 = 5$.

Finally, we can find out the total number of bones in adult men and children by adding the number of bones in adult women skeletons and those in all adult women skeletons. This gives us $250 + 250 = 500$.

So, there are 500 bones in the graveyard. The answer is: $500$.

1. The cost of the 7 books about cats:
\[ \text{Cost of books about cats} = 7 \times \$7 = \$49 \text{ (in dollars)} \]

2. The cost of the 2 books about the solar system:

There are 84 people waiting in line to ride a roller coaster at an amusement park.  The roller coaster has 7 cars, and each car seats 2 people.  How many times will the ride operator have to run the roller coaster to give everyone in line a turn?"," Let's solve this step by step:

1. Calculate the total capacity of the roller coaster: 
   The roller coaster has 7 cars, each seat 2 people, so the total capacity of the ride is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) people per turn.

2. Calculate the number of turns needed to give everyone in line a turn: 
   There are 84 people waiting in line.

3. Calculate the number of turns needed: 
   To reach 14 people per turn, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per turn: 
   \(84 \div 14 = 6\).

Therefore, the ride operator will have to run the roller coaster 6 times to give everyone in line a turn. The answer will be $\boxed{6}$.",81,169,6,1.0,"Each run will hold 7 * 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 people.

Layla is feeding her pet fish. She has two Goldfish which each get one teaspoon of fish food. Her 3 Swordtails each get 2 teaspoons of food. Her 8 Guppies each eat half a teaspoon of food. How much food does she have to give to her fish in total?"," First, let's calculate the food for each type of fish:

1. **Goldfish**: She has 2 Goldfish and each gets 1 teaspoon of food. So:
   - Total for Goldfish = 2 * 1 = 2 teaspoons

2. **Swordtails**: She has 3 Swordtails and each gets 2 teaspoons of food. So:
   - Total for Swordtails = 3 * 2 = 6 teaspoons

3. **Guppies**: She has 8 Guppies and each gets half a teaspoon of food. So:
   - Total for Guppies = 8 * 0.5 = 4 teaspoons

Now, let's add up the total amount of food given to all the fish:

Total food given = (Goldfish's food) + (Swordtails' food) + (Guppies' food)
Total food given = 2 + 6 + 4
Total food given = 12 teaspoons

So, Layla needs to give a total of 12 teaspoons of food to her fish. However, since we want the number of teaspoons in the final answer, we'll round the result to the nearest whole number since the question asks for the final numerical answer. Therefore, the final answer is 12 teaspoons.",86,265,12,1.0,"The two Goldfish eat a total of 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 teaspoons of food.

How much food does she have to give to her fish in total?"," First, calculate the total amount of food given to the Goldfish:
- Each Goldfish gets 1 teaspoon of food.
- Since there are 2 Goldfish, the total amount of food for the Goldfish is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) teaspoons.

Next, calculate the total amount of food given to the Swordtails:
- Each Swordtail gets 2 teaspoons of food.
- Since there are 3 Swordtails, the total amount of food for the Goldfish is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) teaspoons.

Finally, calculate the total amount of food given to the Guppies:
- Each Guppy gets 0.5 teaspoon of food.
- Since there are 8 Guppies, the total amount of food for the Guppies is \(8 \times 0.5 = 4\) teaspoons.

Now, add up the amounts for all the fish (assuming a total of 2 fish + 3 swordtails + 8 guppies = 13 fish):
- Food for the Goldfish = 2 teaspoons
- Food for the Swordtails = 6 teaspoons
- Food for the Guppies = 4 teaspoons

Total food = \(2 + 6 + 4 = 12\) teaspoons.

Since there are 13 fish, we calculate the total amount of food given to them:
- Total food = 12 teaspoons
- Food per fish = 12 / 13 ≈ 0.9091

Since we can't give a fraction of a teaspoon, we'll round this to the nearest whole number:
- Rounded total food = 1 teaspoon

So, Layla needs to give her fish a total of 1 teaspoon of food.",86,355,1,0.0,"The two Goldfish eat a total of 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 teaspoons of food.
