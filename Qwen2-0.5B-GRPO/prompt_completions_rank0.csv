Ahmed and Emily are having a contest to see who can get the best grade in the class. There have been 9 assignments and Ahmed has a 91 in the class. Emily has a 92. The final assignment is worth the same amount as all the other assignments. Emily got a 90 on the final assignment. What is the minimum grade Ahmed needs to get to beat Emily if all grades are whole numbers?"," To beat Emily, Ahmed needs a grade of at least 10. If Emily has a 92 and has completed 6 assignments, we can find the minimum grade she needs for 7 assignments by calculating the average of all assignments and then subtracting that average from Emily's grade.

Given:
- Emily's current grade is 92.
- Emily has completed 6 assignments.
- The final assignment is worth the same as all the other assignments, so we only count the grades received on the assignments.

Emily has received grades of:
- **92** on the first assignment
- **78** on the second assignment
- **85** on the third assignment
- **100** on the fourth
- **90** on the fifth assignment
- **85** on the sixth assignment

The average grade Emily receives over her 6 assignments is:
- **(92 + 78 + 85 + 100 + 90 + 85) / 6 = 397 / 6 = 66.17**

We are looking for the minimum grade Ahmed needs for 7 assignments to beat Emily if all grades are whole numbers. Since we must have at least a 91 on the first assignment and the average grade for the first 6 assignments is 66.17, Ahmed will need a minimum grade of 66.17 on the first grade.

Ahmed has already received 91 from Ahmed. So, he needs:
- **91** total from the first assignment to beat Emily. Therefore, Ahmed needs:
- **91 / 6 = 15.5** The minimum grade Ahmed needs to beat Emily is 15.5, which rounds up to 16, because we only want to consider whole grades. However, since Ahmed received 91 from Emily and we want to focus on beating Emily by the minimum grade she needs to achieve, the minimum grade Ahmed needs to surpass Emily is also 16. However, if Ahmed receives scores that are closer to 15, he will need to double the grade to ensure that Ahmed beats Emily.

Therefore, Ahmed needs at least:
- A 16 on the final assignment to ensure he beats Emily.

The answer is $\boxed{16}$.",111,483,16,0.0,"Ahmed has scored 819 total points in the class thus far because 9 x 91 = <<9*91=819>>819

She scored 918 total points after the final assignment because 828 + 90 = <<828+90=918>>918
Ahmed needs to score a 99 to tie Emily for the semester because 918 - 819 = <<918-819=99>>99

Ahmed and Emily are having a contest to see who can get the best grade in the class. There have been 9 assignments and Ahmed has a 91 in the class. Emily has a 92. The final assignment is worth the same amount as all the other assignments. Emily got a 90 on the final assignment. What is the minimum grade Ahmed needs to get to beat Emily if all grades are whole numbers?"," Let's calculate the total points that Ahmed and Emily have already earned so far.

Ahmed has earned 91 points so far.
Emily has earned 92 points so far.
Emily also got a 90 on the final assignment, which means her current total is 92 + 90 = 182 points.

To find out how many more points Ahmed needs to earn, we first subtract the sum of Ahmed's existing points from 182:

182 (Emily's current points) - 91 (Ahmed's existing points) = 91 points

Ahmed needs to earn 91 more points in the final assignment to beat Emily and maintain his current point total.

Since all grades are whole numbers, Ahmed cannot score a fraction of a point (like 9/9). Therefore, he must score exactly 91 points to avoid getting a lower score than Emily for the final assignment.

Ahmed has already earned 91 points in four assignments, and Emily has already earned 182 points.

To beat Emily, Ahmed needs to earn:

\[ \text{Points needed} = \text{Current points} - \text{Ahmed's points} \]

\[ \text{Points needed} = 91 - 4 = 87 \]

Ahmed needs to score exactly 87 points in the final assignment to beat Emily and maintain his current total. Since he has already scored 91 points, the minimum he needs to reach this score is:

\[ \text{Minimum score} = 91 + 87 = 178 \]

Therefore, Ahmed needs to score at least 178 points on all 10 assignments to beat Emily and maintain his current total score. Since all points are whole numbers, he needs a minimum of 180 points, which can be achieved with a 100 on the last assignment (since a 177 on the last assignment would make him only 91 points short of 180). However, since Ahmed needs 180 points and can only get a 100, he cannot obtain a point by subtracting 100 from a 100 and get rid of it completely and score 0 points. Therefore, Ahmed can always score 100 points on the last assignment, making him completely beat Emily. 

So, Ahmed needs to score at least 180 points on the final assignment to maintain his winning streak, which is achieved when he achieves 100 points on the last assignment. The minimum he needs to earn on the last assignment is:

\[ \text{Points needed} = 100 \]

Ahmed needs to score exactly 100 points on the last assignment to maintain his win streak and beat Emily. This minimum score is achieved by having a 100 on the final assignment, despite the fact that achieving 100 on a final assignment is impossible without a score on the first 8 assignments (since a score of 95 would leave him only 1 point short of the 180 to beat Emily). Therefore, Ahmed cannot score a 100 on the final assignment to maintain his win streak. In reality, it is impossible for Ahmed to score a 100 on the last assignment, as the only way he could achieve a 100 by scoring 100 on the first 8 assignments is if he scored them all 100. 

To summarize: Ahmed needs to score at least 180 points on all 10 assignments to beat Emily and maintain his winning streak. Since Ahmed has already scored 91 points in 4 assignments, he cannot beat Emily with a 100 score on the last assignment. The minimum he needs on the last assignment is 100 points, ensuring that he qualifies as the next top scorer. Therefore, Ahmed can only score 100 points on the last assignment to maintain his winning streak and beat Emily without exceeding his current total. In conclusion, the minimum he needs is:

\[ \text{Points needed} = 100 \]

Ahmed will need to score exactly 100 points on the final assignment to maintain his win streak and beat Emily, which is impossible without a 100 on the last assignment. So, there is no legal way for Ahmed to beat Emily, and his current score will remain at 100 points despite the scoring rules that prevent Ahmed from achieving it on the last assignment. The only possible scenario is that Ahmed will score exactly 100 on the last assignment to maintain his winning streak beyond what he can achieve on the first 8 assignments, achieving an exact 180 points on the final assignment. Therefore, Ahmed does not need to earn any more points on the last assignment, he can maintain his winning streak without any score on it. He needs 80 points",111,1024,80,0.0,"Ahmed has scored 819 total points in the class thus far because 9 x 91 = <<9*91=819>>819

The gauge on a water tank shows that the tank is 1/3 full of water. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?"," First, let's figure out how many gallons of water are currently in the tank. If the tank is 1/3 full and it has 16 gallons of water, then it initially holds:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Initial volume} = \frac{1}{3} \times 16 \]

\[ \text{Initial volume} = 16 \times \frac{3}{1} \]

\[ \text{Initial volume} = 48 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, to fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. The total volume the tank holds will be the initial volume plus the 16 gallons:

\[ \text{Total volume} = \text{Initial volume} + 16 \]

\[ \text{Total volume} = 48 + 16 \]

\[ \text{Total volume} = 64 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the tank will hold 64 gallons of water when full.

Sam, Sid, and Steve brought popsicle sticks for their group activity in their Art class. Sam has thrice as many as Sid, and Sid has twice as many as Steve. If Steve has 12 popsicle sticks, how many popsicle sticks can they use for their Art class activity?"," Let's begin by calculating the number of popsicle sticks each person has based on the information given:

1. **Steve**: Given that Steve has 12 popsicle sticks, we know that Sid also has twice the number of Steve's sticks, so Sid has \(12 \times 2 = 24\) popsicle sticks.

2. **Sid**: Sid has twice as many as Steve, so Sid has \(2 \times 12 = 24\) popsicle sticks.

3. **Sam**: Sam has thrice as many as Sid, so Sam has \(3 \times 24 = 72\) popsicle sticks.

4. **Total sticks**: They have \(12 + 24 + 24 = 60\) popsicle sticks in total.

Now, to find out how many they can use for their Art class activity:

Subtracting the total number of sticks they already have from the total available, we get:

Total sticks used = \(60 - 60 = 0\) popsicle sticks.

Therefore, they cannot use any popsicle sticks for their Art class activity as they have enough for all their needs.
